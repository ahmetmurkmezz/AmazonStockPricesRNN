In this project, Amazon Stock Prices were predicted with using an RNN model, and an attempt was made to create a prediction algorithm. Over 6000 data points were used in this model, the data was visualized, and the performance of the model was also visualized separately. The accuracy rate of the model has shown a success of over 90%. Designed using the structure of neural networks, this model is intended for predicting the first day of 2023. The opening column in the data was trained for prediction
